# Case to improve
- You need to remove the SD card to get the board in and out.  1 mm more and we'd clear
- Different knobs, 4 controls, or a bit bigger case -- it's a bit cramped

# Software to-do
- Getting clicks between tracks at least with Shairplay
- Handle offset / pre-amp gain
- Run `camdac.py` as a service
- Add ability to re-define filters more easily

# Hardware to-do
- USB "gadget" mode for inline digital PEQ
